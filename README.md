# Review Summarization using GPT-2

## Introduction
This project focuses on training a GPT-2 model to generate summaries of product reviews using the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset. The goal is to create a model that can effectively summarize lengthy reviews into concise and accurate summaries.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which contains text reviews and corresponding summaries for various food products.

### Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the 'Text' and 'Summary' columns from the dataset to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- Tokenize the text data using the GPT-2 tokenizer from Hugging Face.

## Model Training
### Setup
- Initialize a GPT-2 tokenizer and model from Hugging Face.
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (75:25 ratio).
- Implement a custom dataset class to prepare the data for training, including data loading, tokenization, and batching.

### Fine-tuning
- Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the review dataset to generate summaries.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance using ROUGE scores on the test set.

### ROUGE Scores
- ROUGE-1: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- ROUGE-2: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- ROUGE-L: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Example:
- Given Review Text: "The Fender CD-60S Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar is a great instrument for beginners..."
- Given Summary: "Good for beginners but has tuning stability issues."
- Generated Summary: "The Fender CD-60S Acoustic Guitar is suitable for beginners, but there are reported tuning stability issues."
- ROUGE Scores (Example): ROUGE-1: Precision: 0.75, Recall: 0.80, F1-Score: 0.77

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/review-summarization-gpt2.git
   cd review-summarization-gpt2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset:
   - Download the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset.
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset as described in the preprocessing section.

4. Train the model:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Results
Include a section in the README to showcase the results of the model, including sample summaries and corresponding ROUGE scores.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and insights gained from training and evaluating the GPT-2 model for review summarization.
